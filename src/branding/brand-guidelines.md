## 2. Brand Voice

Signal Sentinel's tone should be:

- **Calm** – no hype, no panic.
- **Clear** – explain signals plainly.

Avoid:
- Making direct investment recommendations ("you should buy/sell…").
- Overpromising ("guaranteed returns," "always beats the market").

## 6. Messaging Pillars

All external copy and product explanations should reference at least one of:

1. **Automation** – "You define rules; Signal Sentinel runs continuously."
2. **Clarity** – "Alerts explain *why* they fired, not just that they did."
3. **Control** – "Rules and strategies are user-defined. You stay in charge."
4. **Safety** – "Helps you avoid surprises and better manage risk."

Example short blurbs:

- "Signal Sentinel helps you stay ahead of drawdowns, overbought conditions, and recovery points—without staring at charts all day."
- "Turn your trading rules into always-on alerts with AI context."

---

## 7. Legal / Positioning

Signal Sentinel is:

- A **tool for monitoring and analysis**.
- Not a registered investment advisor.
- Not making personalized buy/sell recommendations.

Suggested legal line to include in footer / alerts:

> "Signal Sentinel provides informational alerts only and does not provide financial, investment, or trading advice."
